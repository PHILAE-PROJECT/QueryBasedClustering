# Sequences String Comparison Clustering
This application uses the Sequences String Comparison Clustering algorithm to create clusters.  
It also creates a model in a dot graph format using the provided sequences. In this model inspired by the Prefix Tree Acceptor, the prefixes and the suffixes of the sequences are factorized. There is also an option to add self-loop to the model.
